# Introduction To Robotics (2022-2023)
A repository to learn the basics of robotics for the course of Introduction To Robotics (3rd year, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest) 
This includes: homework requirements, implementation details (code, image files, description).

## Homework 1
### Requirements
**Components**
> RBG  LED  (1  minimum),  potentiometers  (3  minimum),resistors and wires (per logic)

**Technical Task**
> Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of thecolor of the RGB led (Red,Green andBlue).  The control must be donewithdigital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiome-ter with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connectedto the led.
